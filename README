Small 2D platformer game engine in libgdx by https://github.com/dvdfu/

WHAT'S NEW:
-shaking camera settings, more camera fine-tuning
-further refined collisions

TO DO NEXT:
-collision still needs a bit of work but movement is fine as long as pathways aren't squeezed around the player

NOTE:
-ignore the Ramp class
