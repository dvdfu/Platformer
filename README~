Small 2D platformer game engine in libgdx by https://github.com/dvdfu/

WHAT'S NEW:
-code cleanup
-fixed small bug with camera zoom
-platforms!
	-platform objects extend from blocks and are added to the block array
	-platforms are to be added as a separate tile layer from regular blocks
	-platforms yield no horizontal collision and are only solid from above

TO DO NEXT:
-collision still needs a bit of work but movement is fine as long as pathways aren't squeezed around the player

NOTE:
